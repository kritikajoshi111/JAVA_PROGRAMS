/*
 * Static keyword can used with variable declaration , method declaration and also static block.
 * 
 * Static Keyword :-
 * If a variable is declared as static then it will be treated as a class variable rather than instance variable.
 * It means that its memory allocation is dependent on class loading rather than creation of an object.
 * It is also mean that , their will exit only a single copy of static variable for all the object and all the object will share that commonly allocated
 *  memory and object are not allowed to allocate separate memory for static variable.
 *  
 *  we can access static variable without any object directly through the class name.
 *  
 *  Static Method :-
 *  Static method is also independent from the object and we can access these method without any object directly through the class name.
 *  
 *  There is a compulsion that a static method can have only static variable in its definition.
 *  
 *  Static Block :-
 *  Static block is similar to the static method but it has more priority then the main method and it will execute its code before the calling of main method.
 *  
 *  Static block will execute only once in a program.
