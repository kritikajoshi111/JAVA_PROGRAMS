/*
 * Constructor is a special member method of a class . It is called special because:-
 *-> name of the construction will always be same as the class name .
 * 
 *-> It does not have any return type (not even void) and we can not return anything from it.
 * 
 * -> There are three types of constructor
 * 	a)Default constructor ( no arguments)
 * 	b)Parametrised constructor
 * 	c)Copy construction
 * 
 *-> If we do not have any constructor in our class then complier will generate a default constructor itself.
 *
 *-> There is no need to call a constructor explicitly(external) 
 *   it will be called implicitly(automatically) wherever object of the class will be created .
 *   
 *-> We can not inherit constructor .
 * 
 *-> We can call a construction by using new operator
